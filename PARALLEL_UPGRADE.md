- [x] Replace directional Seq binding with symmetric compose join (ComposeWork).
  - Edge cases: both sides emit one NF; one side emits none; left exhausts first with seen data; right exhausts first with seen data; compose fails (unify mismatch); pending emits before more pulls; flip alternates sides for fairness; identical answers dedup to avoid explosion.
- [x] Wire PipeWork to use ComposeWork for And/Fix/Call and remove BindWork/BindProducer queue system.
  - Edge cases: Seq([And(...), rest]) does not spawn one pipe per And answer; Seq with Call uses same CallKey regardless of mid context; Fix recursion still yields via tabling; dual Seq preserves behavior.
- [x] Add focused regression tests for symmetric compose (including a pipe-count explosion test and its dual).
- [x] Replace FixWork queue+producer task with inline producer stepping (single-engine tabling).
  - Edge cases: no answers and producer not started should step + emit; running producer should advance inline; duplicate answer should not emit; producer exhausts with no new answers -> Done; producer exhausts with new answers -> restart iteration; producer reentrancy should not interleave steps; multiple handles should replay the same answers; table done returns Done without stepping.
- [x] Replace AndGroup with queue-backed joiner (bounded producer queues + joiner output queue).
  - Edge cases: empty closed part terminates And immediately even if other parts block (plus dual).
- [x] Re-run program_synth regression tests and confirm they emit within the step budget (release).
